they friends will welcome back to the channel and to love club of the ongoing series where we're going to be exploring principal strategies and tools that can help us build longer lasting and more fulfilling relationships in all areas of life at one of the biggest predictors of our health and happiness in life is the quality of our relationships and there's a bunch of studies that show that it's really the quality of your single romantic relationship that correlate what's with all of these positive health and happiness outcomes but developing these sorts of relationship is not necessarily easy especially in a world where we've got so much choice and we have seemingly so little time while ago i had a great conversation with a behavioral scientist who specializes in the field of dating and relationships and name is logan yuri she's currently head of behavioral science at hinged the dating up and she's written a fantastic book called how to not die alone which i first read over a year ago and it completely changed the way that i approach dating and my love life not one of the things that i really love about logan work is that she really kind of fights against this attitude that we are a lot of us have by default which is that love is this special natural thing that should not be analyzed and one of the things she says throughout her book is that okay love might be natural but dating certainly is not and so in this video i want to share eight of logan top tips from the field of behavioral science that we can apply to a dating lives of these are the ones that i found particularly helpful when it comes to my dating life so i hope you'll find them helpful as well tip number one is to throw away the checklist so often people come to me and they say logan i knew exactly what i want i just need your help finding that person then they go through this list of he must be over six feet tall he must make at least six figures he must love travel he must have parents who are not divorced and they go on and on and on with this list that the issue a checklist which is what logan talks about in the book is that we generally make a choice nicholas that optimizes for the wrong things and generally when we make the checklist we are optimizing for a prom date rather than a life partner not the prom date is the one who is like fun and exciting and stuff in the short term but who ultimately does not probably probably won't make for good long term partner whereas the life partner is someone who like stay with you through thick and thin and through the ups and downs of life what youth think you why is not what's actually going to make you happy long term and so my husband is a five foot a red headed v again engineer do you think that if i made a checklist those would be all the things that my less know that wouldn't have been on my lips but he is brilliant he is hilarious he understands me better than i understand myself we have the most fun together we see the world in a similar way i couldn't have made a list to find my husband and so take your tactless take your so called type rip it up be willing to say i'm in a date different types of people and see what side of me they bring out so be stripped of that how you want your partner to make you feel and the life you want and be flexible about how they show up in the world and what qualities they have a generally when it comes to finding a life partner we want someone who's loyal who's kind who's emotionally stable who knows how to communicate well someone who's going to growth mindset someone that you can personally grow with someone that you can make hard decisions with but these are really the sort of things that tend to have in or checklist tip number two is to overcome the hesitate her mind that are in behavioral science there is this thing called the intention action gap which is a fancy way of saying that we have things that we want to do but that we end up not doing so there's a gap between our intention and action and this is really common in the field of dating like you always hear people say oh i'll start dating when i lose ex cement out of weight or i'll start dating when i have my life more together or i'll start dating when dot dot dot and there's a bunch of tips that logan gives in her book how to not die alone for how to overcome the hesitate a mindset if you're one of those people for example you could set deadlines if you want like for example three weeks from now i'm going to have made my hinch profile and i'm going to have gone on x number of dates there's often a bunch of prep work is needed and during the prep is often actually easier than going on the date so you could for example if you during the online dating thing dunno the dating apps trying to find some decent decent photos of yourself ask a friend to take some decent photos of you all of that kind of stuff you can absolutely do in advance you can tell other people about your intention to start dating and that or ultimately helps to reinforce the identity to yourself which she talks about and book quite a lot like it sounds kind of way to say but even if you for example stand in front of a mirror and say i am the sort of person that goes on dates i am looking for a life partner it sounds super corny but apparently there's some evidence from behavioral science that suggests that that changes the way that we think of iran on identities and generally people who are hesitated don't have that identity in the mind of i am the sort of person that goes on dates and so we kind of want to change that and then another tip is to just start small let you talk to the book about how people are often like over optimize the when it comes to dating a lot yeah i'm going to go on five days a week and because i don't have time to gone five days a week there's no point doing it at all but generally when he finally stop procrastinating from something if you just lower the bar maybe one days a week maybe just on a thursday night that can be my date night maybe even one day a month at for better than nothing if you're trying to find this hypothetical her and not imaginary life partner tip number three don't fall into the interview try i think this was really good so i actually read this tip in the book before having the conversation with logan and i was reading it around the same time as i was going on the first several dates with my future wife and on a second date we went to play top golf which is this thing where you're sort of like ten pin bowling needs a golf and there was something about doing the experience rather than just sort of sitting across from each what from each other over dinner that helped us bond a lot more than we would have done over just like a fairly a dry and boring meal for example the next thing is what do you actually doing on that day so many dates are these job interviews where i sit across from you and i say what did you study and why and how many siblings you have and what's your five year plan and you know it who cares that doesn't really affect our ability to be in a relationship together it's dry it's boring coffee dates that feeling job interviews all feed into the same why can't we do an activity together why can't we meet up in a park and run around and try to pet five dogs why can't we go to a street with a lot of dumpling places and create our own dumpling to our and figure out our best one and nice thing about this is that even if you don't end up vibe and then at least you've had a bit of a fun experience doing this experience type thing and it's also good because generally when we're doing something when a mine is occupied by doing a thing it's sort of helps us let our guard down and so if you personally of the sort of person that that struggles with anxiety or something when it comes to a date by doing something while on the date it helps you not think about it too much but it also helps the other person that you're dating relax into it and so you get more of an idea of what they're really like actually on that no one of the things i often do when i'm filming videos is i i like to have a thing in my hand and just having a thing in my hand and a cup of tea to sip on helps me feel a lot more comfortable in front of the camera and i think it's that same concept applied to the water dating to go for experiences roll in job interviews tip them before the peak and rule and this is concept in behavioral science called the peak and rule which is a thing has been replicated a lot in the psychology studies that's basically the idea that when it comes to the memory that we have on of of an experience where way more likely somewhat unsurprisingly to remember the peak bit so the really intensity positive or negative bit and also the end of the experience now when it comes to being on a date is not a lot that we can do about the peak positive negative experiences but what we can do is try and make sure the ending is pretty solid end on a high note there's amazing research from the behavioral economist daniel kahneman which found that when people are getting call and ask appease they'd actually rather get a call and ask you pee that slightly longer but ends in a less painful way because we disproportionately remember things based on how they and so even if you have a mediocre date you can say that by ending on a high now you can as someone for a kiss and give them the great kiss you can order dessert you can give them a meaningful compliment you can show them a surprise mural that they've never seen before and so really think about how can i and this state in a meaningful and fine and memorable way tip number five is the second date rule some of the best people i know do not perform well and first states they are awkward they are not comfortable they are not good at small talk they're more introverted this is harder for them but these are people who would make great long term partners and so how can we actually take the pressure off the first aid say first dates are almost a warm up around it's ah do i like the sound of your voice and my attracted you to have some going to talk about and i'm with the know assume that we're going to go on the second date pending that nothing crazy or terrible are unsafe happens on the first state and that way if you go in assuming you're gone the second date you're giving people more of a shy and it's easier to find those diamond in a rough people who get better over time now in the book live in talks about this idea of the spa rock vs the slow burn and a lot of us optimized for feeling the spark on the first date feeling that intense chemistry and if we don't feel it than we might think i don't really know if i like this person but if you ensure you go on the second date like that just a general rule that unless the first date go disastrously wrong you're always at least offer to go on a second date with the person assuming they consent ooh that of is a and that might just mean that maybe if you go on a second date with someone will you didn't quite feel the sparks of the chemistry with the fireworks in the first day but you might actually feel it on the second date and that's when you know that oh okay this is actually kind of interesting could maybe that god was down maybe you're both a little bit more comfortable with you with each other and so i've applied to throw my life and i got a first date assuming it's not a complete disaster i'd always be like a you wanna do this again and then i'll make a proper decision after the second day tip number six is the experience show rather than the evaluative mindset that i found this to be super helpful in my life like there there are some friends i know who go on dates and who almost treat it as if it's a job interview where they've got the checklist and the mind in the like is this person taking all these boxes whereas the friends i know who succeed when it comes to dating i have a bit more of an experiential approach of like i'm just going to see if i vibe with this person and certainly in the past when i've been on dates feeling a bit evaluative about it huh i wonder what is both like i'm i'm gonna in my head i'm not actually fully in the present moment whereas from just focusing on the experience show approach to it that like how do i feel how of this person make me feel all that kind of stuff it just feels a lot more natural and it feels like i'm just thinking about it less i think with with dating it's one of those things where even though there's videos like this and if you've gone to this point then you clearly care about kind of and evidence based approach to dating and relationships and stuff but there's this fine line between thinking about it and planning it and being intentional about it and going so overboard that it's sort of takes the joy and the experience out of the thing and so i find that like keeping keeping that in mind there's always it was a middle way you something to keep in mind to the evaluative mindset as are you good enough for me where did you go to uni what are your table manners i'm constantly judging you against this rubric in my head and saying are you get enough the experiential mindset is i'm going to be in the moment with you i am going to be looking at q is for how i feel and if i'm having fun and am i laughing but i'm not judging you i think we just do so much better when we are in the moment having fun letting time pass vs when we are constantly evaluating some i am even what use said before about having a job description and measuring somebody against this i feel like as a culture one of the biggest mistakes that were making his were saying let's take what works at work and let's apply that to dating and that's a mistake this is a date this is not a job interview if you are showing up with the corporate mindset and a spreadsheet and you're giving me fifteen minutes to give your investor pitch you're going to go and one hundred aids is not going to work out because that is not what leads to connection and so yes it's great that you are killing and at your job if you are applying all of what you do it your job to dating you're probably not having the connection that you're looking for a fast forwarding to me in the future this interview that i did with logan yuri is part of deep dive which is the weekly podcast the i do where i interview cool people and that podcast has been going on for

slash ali and if he sign up there you'll get your nebula details email to you to thank you so much curiosity stream for sponsoring this video to them seven his basement percent versus penthouse person there's an activity called a penthouse in a basement person you think in your life not even in a romantic setting who is my penthouse person who when i'm with them to they bring my energy up to i feel creative do i feel inspire them this is another solitaire were like we've all had that feeling where there are some people that super energize us and there are some people that when we hang out with them completely drains our energy and i think in the world of dating speaking about this idea of an experiential mindset we want to be mindful of the experience of does hanging out with this person energize me do i feel do i leave the date feeling energized and feeling motivated and stuff or does hang out with this person potentially drain my energy and generally you probably don't want to go beyond the second date with someone who dreams you energy and ten number eight is to have the humility to treat it like an experiment and really dating is a lot about learning about yourself rather than just learning about the other person i think approaching it with this attitude of like hey i'm just going to try now is just a bit of an experiment helps us to avoid the hesitate a mindset helps us to avoid over think about this potential date that we may or may not be going on dating in the modern sense was invented at the end of around eighty nine this is a relatively new concept in terms of the span of human history and then dating on apps is around a decade old with swipe the and all that being extremely new and so part of it is just having humility around the fact that a lot of us are just making this up as we go along this is not something that we know how to do and thinking about it as an experiment means you learn something for every failure because it's and of really a video the with learn from it and to be honest your i'm very lucky to find a lover your life on the first date like there's a rule had a thirty seven percent rule which i love right in the book club video about this which will be linked over there and on their which is essentially that we have to do quite a lot of dating usually before we can find that could perfect person even if even if we buy into this idea which is not true that there exists a perfect person out there generally it's about finding someone who coined logan anyway i'm not an extra on this finding someone who you feel like you can build that kind of future with and then working together to build a future together and we thank you so much watching this video if you've got to the and you're gonna love the interview with
